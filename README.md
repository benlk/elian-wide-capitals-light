## Elian Wide Capitals

A geometric sans-serif with the following characteristics:

- vertical-aligned (as much as possible) small letters
- horizontally-aligned large letters
- x height of half of ascender height

It does not have numerals, as numerals were never specified in [C.C. Elian's original document](http://www.ccelian.com/ElianScriptFull.html).

Honestly, having the ascender and descender be a full x-height, and having the the stroke widths so thin, probably means that this is a display font and not a general body font. Oh well.
